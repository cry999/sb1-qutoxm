# Comparison between our C4 Model Constructor and cry999/c4map

## Similarities

1. Both projects aim to create C4 model diagrams.
2. Both use React as the frontend framework.
3. Both likely use a canvas-based approach for rendering diagrams.

## Differences

1. Technology Stack:
   - Our project: Uses Vite, React, TypeScript, and reactflow for diagram creation.
   - c4map: Likely uses Create React App or a similar setup. May use a different diagramming library.

2. UI Components:
   - Our project: Custom-built C4 elements using Lucide React icons.
   - c4map: May use a different icon set or custom SVGs for C4 elements.

3. Diagram Interaction:
   - Our project: Drag-and-drop interface for adding elements, with a toolbar.
   - c4map: Might use a different interaction model, possibly a more traditional UI with buttons or menus.

4. Data Management:
   - Our project: Currently uses React state for managing diagram elements.
   - c4map: Might use a more sophisticated state management solution like Redux or MobX.

5. Export/Import:
   - Our project: Currently doesn't support exporting or importing diagrams.
   - c4map: Likely supports exporting diagrams as images or JSON, and possibly importing them.

6. Collaboration Features:
   - Our project: No built-in collaboration features.
   - c4map: May include features for real-time collaboration or sharing diagrams.

7. Customization:
   - Our project: Limited customization of element styles.
   - c4map: Might offer more extensive customization options for colors, shapes, and styles.

8. Layout Algorithms:
   - Our project: Relies on manual positioning of elements.
   - c4map: May include automatic layout algorithms for organizing elements.

9. Relationship Types:
   - Our project: Basic relationships between elements.
   - c4map: Might support more complex relationship types and visual representations.

10. Documentation:
    - Our project: Limited inline documentation.
    - c4map: Likely includes more comprehensive documentation and examples.

## Potential Improvements for Our Project

1. Implement export/import functionality for diagrams.
2. Add more customization options for C4 elements.
3. Introduce automatic layout algorithms.
4. Enhance relationship types and their visual representation.
5. Improve documentation and add usage examples.
6. Consider adding collaboration features.
7. Implement undo/redo functionality.
8. Add support for different levels of C4 diagrams (Context, Container, Component, Code).

This comparison is based on typical features of C4 modeling tools and may not accurately reflect the exact implementation of cry999/c4map. To get a more precise comparison, we would need to analyze the actual code and features of the c4map project.
